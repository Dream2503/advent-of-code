## 📖 What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AoC) is an annual set of programming puzzles created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).  
It runs every December from the 1st to the 25th, with a new two-part puzzle released each day.

The key ideas:

- 🧩 **Daily Puzzles**: Each day unlocks a new puzzle with a fun, Christmas-themed story.
- ⭐ **Two Parts**: Solving part one reveals part two, usually a twist that builds on the first solution.
- 🌍 **Language Agnostic**: You can solve the puzzles in any programming language you like.
- 🏆 **Learning & Challenge**: Great for practicing algorithms, improving problem-solving, and writing cleaner code.

Thousands of developers worldwide take part, making it both a personal challenge and a community event.
